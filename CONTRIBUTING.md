# Contributing to Eclipse 4diac Website Hugo

Thanks for your interest in this project.

[Eclipse 4diac](https://eclipse.dev/4diac) is an Open Source Framework for Industrial Automation & Control. 
It is a reference implementation for the IEC 61499 standard. 
IEC 61499 defines a domain specific modeling language for developing distributed industrial control solutions.
IEC 61499 extends IEC 61131-3 by improving the encapsulation of software components for increased re-usability, providing a vendor independent format, and simplifying support for controller to controller communication.
Its distribution functionality and the inherent support for dynamic reconfiguration provide the required infrastructure for Industrie 4.0 and industrial IoT applications.

## Development Environment

To build and develop the Eclipse 4diac Website you need:

- Hugo static web site generator

To locally test simply run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

```
  hugo server
```

This will

- generate all HTML pages into the `public` directory of your working copy,
- launch a local webserver, where you can preview your changes, and
- watch any changes on the input files to automatically regenerate the HMTL files and reload the preview in the browser.
