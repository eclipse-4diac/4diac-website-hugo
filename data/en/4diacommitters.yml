      <p>Bianca Wiesmayr is part of the project team of Eclipse 4diac. 
         In addition to her research, she is an active software developer for the open-source development environment Eclipse 4diac. 
         She researches model-driven methods for developing automation systems. 
         Her dissertation investigated the use of behavior models for the implementation and maintenance of control software in the domain-specific modeling language defined in IEC 61499. 
         Many of her results are available open source in Eclipse 4diac. 
         Additionally, she has worked on improving the usability of the modeling editor.</p>
