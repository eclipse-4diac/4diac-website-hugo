        abstract: "<h3>Single source instead of proprietary code</h3>
           <p>Primetals Technologies (PT) is a leading plant builder, automation and digitalization solutions provider, and metallurgical services partner for the global metals industry. To operate complete plants in the steel and aluminum industry, from the processing of iron ore to the finished product, such as a steel or aluminum strip, many complex automation solutions are required. Developing these solutions presents many challenges: the number of necessary software solutions required for the different types of plants, the need to deliver the solutions on different platforms, and the need to ensure maintainability over many years. In addition, the unique characteristics of each plant and the specific requirements of steel producers demand a high degree of flexibility in automation software development.</p>
           <p>To stay ahead of future challenges, PT continuously analyzes existing software solutions and develops approaches for a modular software structure. PT is working on a development environment based on the IEC 61499 standard in which automation software can be developed and compiled for different platforms from a single source. To ensure the traceability and quality of software changes PT relies on tools for version control, traceable delivery of artifacts, and a powerful test environment.</p>
           <p>All this is combined in a development environment that provides developers with all the tools they need to efficiently develop, deploy, maintain, and support high-quality, reusable automation software.</p>"

          abstract: |
            <p> Designing Industrial Distributed Control Systems (IDCS) involves balancing functionality, device mapping, and network communication—yet IEC 61499 often abstracts the communication layer, leaving real-time network behavior underrepresented. 
                To bridge this gap, we introduce messages and channels as novel modeling elements that extend the IEC 61499 standard. These elements provide a structured way to define how data flows across networks, enabling more precise modeling of real-time communication, particularly for networks based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols. 
                This talk will focus on how these elements work in practice, demonstrating their value in aligning application design with network performance to support robust, time-sensitive systems.

          presenter: Oscar Miguel Escrig
          abstract: |
            <p>The concept of event is the backbone of the programming for distributed control systems that the standard IEC 61499 proposes. 
               The paradigm shift that this concept implies brings the opportunity to re-think process regulation. 
               In this sense, event-based control theory seems a suiting approach that matches standard’s implementation characteristics. 
               Despite the reported benefits of the pairing event-based control and IEC 61499, it is not exempt of some problems that must be avoided. 
               Identifying, characterizing and addressing these problems has been my main research line through the years, and, in this presentation, I would like to share some of the lessons learned along the way with the audience.</p>

          presenter: Martin Melik Merkumians
          abstract: |
            <p> 4diac FORTE is a powerful runtime environment for IEC 61499 applications, but its capabilities can be extended to support new communication layers and IO modules.  
            Communication layers can be presentation layer protocols, like JSON, XML, the IEC 61499 Compliance Profile for Feasibility Demonstrations, or the universally loved raw data layer. They can also be transport layer protocols, like TCP/IP, MQTT, or OPC UA. Depending on the concrete use case, these layers can be used to communicate with other devices, services, or systems, but sometimes the available communication layers are not sufficient to meet the requirements of a specific application.  
            </p>  

            <p> The same holds true for IO access. While 4diac FORTE brings many IO integrations with it, such as Embrick or Raspberry SPS, sometimes IO modules are a mix of communication and IO access, such as the Beckhoff ADS interface. Still, there are always new IO modules that can be sensors, actuators, or other devices that interact with the physical world.  
            </p>  

            <p> To support new and veteran 4diac users and developers, in this session, we will explore how to extend 4diac FORTE to support new communication protocols and IO devices, enabling the development of more versatile and adaptable industrial automation solutions.
