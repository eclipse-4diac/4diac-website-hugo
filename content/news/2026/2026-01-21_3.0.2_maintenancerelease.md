## Highlights of 4diac IDE 3.0.2 fixes:
- Fixed issues when changing FB types from data to adapter connections (and vice versa).
- Corrected the FORTE code generator to include missing package names in internal FB configuration strings.
- Reset variables without explicit defaults correctly in the evaluator.
- Improved AttributeSearch to consider fully qualified attribute names, including package names.
- Fixed setting of VarConfig in FBTypes.
- Prevented recursive insertion of FBs and typed subapps into themselves.
- Gracefully handle circular dependencies when loading types, logging warnings and creating error types.
- Limited GitHub URL error reporting to 4k characters to avoid overly long stack traces.
- Fixed issues in OCL checks, including warnings about double quotes and subapp-invariant repairs for untyped subapps (#1850).
- Ensured plugin.properties of the model UI plugin is included in the build, restoring missing UI text.
- Corrected handling of VAR_IN_OUTs in Plug Type Interfaces.


## Highlights of 4diac FORTE fixes:
- Corrected IO FBs to include the package name, fixing issues with package-scoped references.
