  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from December 26, 2025 to January 09, 2026.
  
  This two-week focuses on keeping the Eclipse 4diac IDE aligned with the latest Eclipse platform while further polishing graphical editing, connection handling, and build quality. 
  Alongside the upgrade to a new target platform, several usability issues were fixed and internal tooling was cleaned up.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Platform & build infrastructure**
  - Upgraded to the **Eclipse 2026-03 target platform**, simplifying builds by removing obsolete dependency checks.
  - Fixed missing `plugin.properties` entry in build properties of the model UI plugin.
  - Added additional Maven configuration for Sonar analysis.
  - Resolved most Sonar-reported issues in the application plugin and UI tests.

- **Graphical editing & positioning**
  - Fixed pixel scaling issues and stabilized `SetPositionCommand` tests.
  - Corrected automatic FB insertion behavior for empty subapps.
  - Improved undo behavior when creating connections via connection markers.

- **Connections & markers**
  - Reworked utility markers and stylers, improving structure and reuse of existing marker infrastructure.
  - Switched utility markers to the Eclipse marker infrastructure.
  - Added a base handler and source marker handler for graphical markers.
  - Ensured connection endpoint markers are removed after successful connection creation.
  - Allowed marked connection creation in both directions.
  - Refined modifier-key handling so event creation mode only activates when **Ctrl** is pressed alone.

- **Type system & model fixes**
  - Fixed handling of `VAR_IN_OUT` pins in plug type interfaces (#1997).
  - Added member access pins to the `InitialValueHelper`.

- **Internal cleanups**
  - Extracted handler service access into a helper.
  - Removed unused methods and performed general code cleanup.
