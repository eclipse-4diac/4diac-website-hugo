## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Type System & Library Infrastructure**
  - Removed obsolete editable type entries and adapter-related functionality.
  - Introduced a unified *library element provider* and integrated it across:
    - Decorators and content providers
    - Refactorings and quick fixes
    - Bulk editor
    - Type and system editors
    - ST editor
    - Debug UI
  - Added supporting infrastructure for library elements:
    - Dependency tracker and updater
    - Activation listener
    - State listener
    - Undo manager
    - Sub-editor input

- **Editor & Viewer Behavior**
  - Fixed editor and viewer background handling to consistently use theme colors, ensuring correct appearance in dark mode and clear differentiation between editor and viewer.
  - Fixed moving blocks between editors.
  - Enabled seamless connections between graphical editors.
  - Improved connection feedback when crossing viewer borders.
  - Re-enabled canvas panning via middle mouse button and space + left mouse button.
  - Removed now unnecessary drag-and-drop handling due to improved direct editor interaction.

- **Interaction & Usability Improvements**
  - Restricted predecessor functionality to the same subapplication.
  - Improved connection handling:
    - Fixed FB type change with differing connection types.
    - Invoked connection source marker handler only on left click.
    - Tuned connection colors and added dedicated dark mode variants.
  - Fixed mouse cursor handling outside the source editor (currently Windows-only).
  - Improved auto-expose and scrolling behavior:
    - Moved view search logic to the edit domain.
    - Added a custom auto-expose helper with improved thresholds and acceleration.
    - Used the FordiacViewportAutoexposeHelper in the ECC editor.
  - Fixed marquee selection issues when crossing editor borders.

- **Modeling & Semantics**
  - Deployed initial values of member input variables.
  - Promoted invalid assignment of inputs to an error.
  - Fixed missing package name in internal FB configuration strings.
  - Reset variables without explicit defaults in the evaluator.
  - Fixed recursive insert checks for FBs.
  - Fixed attribute search to correctly consider fully qualified type names.
  - Fixed setting of `VarConfig` in FB types.

- **Navigation & Views**
  - Updated the Type Navigator to show only type libraries.

- **Robustness**
  - Improved handling of circular dependencies when loading types by logging warnings and creating error types during import.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE


- **API Documentation**
  - Cleaned up Doxygen configuration by removing obsolete `STRIP_FROM_PATH` entries.
  - Added `stdfblib` to the Doxygen input directories.
  - Fixed Doxyfile paths to ensure correct documentation generation.

- **Composite FBs & IO Layer**
  - Fixed fully qualified names of FBs in the IO layer.
