  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from December 12 to December 19, 2025.
  
  
  This week’s updates focus on strengthening robustness and consistency across the Eclipse 4diac toolchain. 
  4diac IDE received a broad set of fixes and refinements around type handling, refactoring, validation, and UI stability, 
  while 4diac FORTE continues to improve code quality and OPC UA-related internals.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Type system and model consistency**
  - Fixed handling of different type responses in query results, ensuring all parsed responses are correctly reflected in the response model (#1776).
  - Improved adapter type change handling across all FB types, ensuring model updates are properly propagated to editors.
  - Corrected error event pin handling when changing adapter types in CFBs, avoiding spurious pins (#1916).
  - Introduced dedicated instance and full-copy methods for interface lists to prevent incomplete or incorrect copying.

- **Refactoring, copy, and rename robustness**
  - Improved folder handling for copy refactorings, including explicit support for copying folders in `CopyTypeParticipant`.
  - Fixed references to outdated rename participants when renaming system files.
  - Added quick fixes and validation for package name issues, including configurable severity preferences.

- **Validation and parsing improvements**
  - Ensured array and struct value converters fully consume input strings to avoid silently ignoring invalid suffixes.
  - Added validation for package names and for the `DataTypeTreeSelectionDialog`.
  - Improved equals-check handling in NatTable and variable declaration updates, especially for empty cells and default values.

- **UI stability and usability**
  - Prevented exceptions when there is nothing to show in the debug view.
  - Cleaned up initialization and refresh logic in property sheets to avoid duplicate refreshes.
  - Improved robustness when disposing and re-opening outline pages in multi-page editors.
  - Clarified variable names in UI sections and moved UI messages to `plugin.properties`.

- **Maintenance**
  - Regenerated the model to fix compilation errors.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **OPC UA API and code quality improvements**
  - Added a `getDisplayName` function to improve readability and external use.
  - Moved private static helper functions into anonymous namespaces for better encapsulation.
  - Improved OPC UA helpers by using string views and updating struct type handling to replace the IEC 61499 namespace delimiter.


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
