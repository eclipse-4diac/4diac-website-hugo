  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from May 9 to May 16, 2025.
  
  This week's Eclipse 4diac updates bring improvements to 4diac IDE including enhanced Structured Text export, improved monitoring stability, and refined function block configuration and type library handling. On 4diac FORTE side the improvements are better modular IO integration, support for non-finite floating-point values, and modernization of internal data structures using standard C++.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **4diac FORTE Export Improvements**
  - Fixed null pointer exceptions when handling comments inside Composite FBs.
  - Corrected variable declaration order for `InOut` FBs.
  - Fixed handling of ARRAY string IDs for array interface elements.
  - Reworked output parameter generation for better semantic alignment.
  - Changed Structured Text argument mapping to use `ITypedElement`.

- **Function Block and Library Updates**
  - Added eIO Function Blocks to the type library.
  - Removed `QI` and `QO` ports and related service sequences from configuration FBs.

- **Monitoring and Debugging**
  - Fixed race conditions in watch error handling that caused flickering in the UI.
  - Prevented writes through monitoring values when connected to Subapp inputs.
  - Improved error reporting for inconsistencies in Subapp interface values.

- **Usability and Preferences**
  - Renamed launch configurations for clarity and added localization support.
  - Enabled default scopes using preferences.
  - Enhanced parsing of qualified variable names in VarConfigurations.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Modular IO and Infrastructure Refactoring**
  - Introduced the new eIO concept into the Modular IO subsystem.
  - Updated Modular IO slave index handling to use `size_t`.
  - Removed usage of `CSinglyLinkedList` in IO infrastructure and HTTP module.
  - Marked `CSinglyLinkedListNode` as deprecated in favor of STL containers.

- **Data Type and String Conversion Improvements**
  - Added full support for `infinity` and `NaN` values in `(L)REAL` `toString` and `fromString`.
  - Ensured proper formatting of non-finite numbers when converting to/from strings.
  - Replaced `strtod` with `strtof` on all platforms for correct non-finite number handling.
  - Removed finite-value checks to allow parsing of `NaN` and `infinity`.

- **Execution Semantics**
  - Reworked output parameter assignments to better align with function call semantics (i.e., assignments happen on exit).
  
- **Embrick and Code Maintenance**
  - Fixed issues related to new index data type for Embrick devices.
  - Added generated tracing files and resolved related build errors.
