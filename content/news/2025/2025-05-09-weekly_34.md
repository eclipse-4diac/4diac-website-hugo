  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from May 2 to May 9, 2025.
  
  This week's Eclipse 4diac updates include improvements to 4diac IDE such as enhanced type export, improved UI for function block networks, and better support for modeling timing information. Meanwhile, 4diac FORTE benefits from significant modernization and performance optimizations, including memory-efficient data structures, simplified code architecture, and improved support for hardware devices.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Model and Export Enhancements**
  - Removed unused timestamps from the *Data response model* and *EventOccurrence* model.
  - Added `startTime` and `duration` attributes to the model.
  - Implemented a new type export builder and extracted the exporter from the export wizard.
  - Added `CBasicFB::setInitialValues` in the 4diac FORTE exporter to ensure ECC state reset.
  - Used absolute data port index for `read/writeData` in the `forte_ng` exporter.
  - Encapsulated global constants in the `forte_ng` export.

- **Editor and UI Updates**
  - Added a VarConfiguration property sheet for typed subapps in the FB Network Editor.
  - Disabled editing of attributes within Typed Subapps and Composite FBs.
  - Added an option to draw 5-segment connections in the FB Network Editor.

- **Operational Semantics (OpSem)**
  - Added evaluator support for start times.
  - Fixed model issues:
    - Corrected `ECStateAnnotations.getActiveState`.
    - Fixed interpreter test cases and resource loading issues.

- **New Hardware Support**
  - Added a new Function Block for Wago 750-636 DC-Drive-Controller (24V 5A).


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Monitoring and Performance Improvements**
  - Removed timestamps from Event Watches for better performance.
  - Removed unused monitoring infrastructure:
    - Deleted `CSinglyLinkedList` in favor of `std::vector`.
    - Turned event, data, and monitoring watch lists into vectors.
    - Removed unnecessary copy constructors and static methods.
  - Improved memory efficiency by moving the event count buffer to a single `std::vector`.

- **Code Modernization and Cleanup**
  - Removed legacy `CTOR Defines`.
  - Moved `force` flag from `CIEC_ANY` to FBs to save memory.
  - Moved generic `setInitialValues` to `GenFB`.
  - Encapsulated global constants into class definitions.
  - Cleaned up resource includes and adapter usage:
    - Updated `IOReviPiBusAdapter`.
    - Updated `WagoBusAdapter`.

- **Functionality and Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed a one-cycle delay caused by timer list processing ([#410](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-forte/issues/410)).

- **Architecture Improvements**
  - Introduced a common base class for handling internal variables in Simple and Basic FBs.
  - Extracted interface specifications and helpers into dedicated files for future extension.

- **Hardware Support**
  - Enhanced position detection and supported IOs for the Wago 750-636 device.


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
