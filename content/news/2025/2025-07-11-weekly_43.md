## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **System Explorer & Navigator**
  - Fix:  
    - Working sets and resource content no longer conflict when shown as root in the system explorer.
    - Correct system explorer refresh on marker changes.
  - Cleanup:  
    - Removed root content from navigator and replaced it with resource content.
    - Removed `DistributedSystemListener`, which caused UI flickering and tree reordering.
  - Added:
    - Missing working set filters needed for working set content support.

- **Type Management & Editors**
  - Refactor:  
    - Extracted the Xtext type editor page to be reused beyond the FB type editor.
    - Improved the `CommonElementImporter` handling of `TypedSubApp` VarConfig pins.
    - Introduced `ResourceTypeExporter` to `FordiacTypeResource`.
  - Robustness:
    - Catch all exceptions when loading types to improve logging and resilience.

- **Interpreter**
  - Avoid network copying in the interpreter.
  - Added support for untyped `SubApp`s.

- **UI & Usability**

    - Copying behavior in NatTable even when no cell is selected.
    - Connection layout configuration with a new timeout preference.
  - Fixes:
    - Missing `plugin.properties` in binary distribution ([#1432](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-ide/issues/1432)).
    - Fixed a missing import.
    - Updated package metadata for 1.0.0-style declaration.

- **Error Reporting**
  - New Feature:  
    - Bug report dialog now pre-fills GitHub issues with error details and stack traces.
    - Fixed link to the contributor page.

- **Other**
  - Upgrade:   Integrated Eclipse ELK 0.10.0 release.
