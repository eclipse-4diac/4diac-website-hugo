That's right, now you can **take Eclipse 4diac™ with you on the go!** Whether you're commuting, working in the lab, or simply relaxing, you can play our podcast on your Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Alexa, or wherever you enjoy your audio content. 

### What to Expect from Our First Episode

In our inaugural episode, we lay the groundwork for understanding the modern industrial landscape. We begin by discussing the foundational **IEC 61131-3 standard for PLC programming**. You'll learn that a **PLC is, basically, a small computer used in industry** with inputs and outputs for controlling various systems. We'll explain how PLCs are **programmed according to the required application** using an **IDE (integrated development environment) supplied by the PLC vendor**. These IDEs run on your normal computer and allow for **coding your application and then uploading it to the PLC**. We'll also touch upon the **five different programming languages** part of the IEC 61131-3 standard, including **Ladder Diagram (LD)** and **Function Block Diagram (FBD)**. You'll understand how **Function Blocks (FBs)** in this context can be interpreted as **functions you can call**, with inputs corresponding to parameters and outputs to return values.

We then journey beyond traditional PLCs, exploring the challenges of **centralized systems and vendor-specific communication** that led to the emergence of **IEC 61499**. Discover how **IEC 61499 defines a domain-specific modeling language for developing distributed industrial control solutions**. This standard significantly **extends IEC 61131-3** by **improving the encapsulation of software components for increased re-usability**, providing a **vendor-independent format**, and **simplifying support for controller-to-controller communication**. Importantly, **IEC 61499 provides the required infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and industrial IoT applications**.

The episode will illuminate key concepts of IEC 61499, including the **event-driven nature of Function Blocks**. You'll learn how the **FB interface differentiates events (shown as red lines) and data (shown as blue lines)**. We explain that **events trigger the functionalities of the FBs**, which then use the available data. The **behavior of a Function Block depends on its Event Execution Control**, which coordinates the execution of encapsulated functionalities and sending of output events. We'll detail how **applications are created by connecting individual FBs** and how they can be **split and deployed across multiple devices (PLCs)**. You'll also be introduced to the three kinds of Function Blocks: **Basic Function Blocks (BFB)**, where you can define a state machine using the Execution Control Chart (ECC); **Composite Function Blocks (CFB)**, which simply have an internal network of other FBs; and **Service Interface Function Blocks (SIFB)**, which are needed to access specific hardware parts and the platform. Finally, we touch on **Compliance Profiles**, which are specified by the standard to **fill the gaps due to its abstraction**.

Basically it is the same Information you can find here [IEC 61499 101](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-documentation/blob/main/src/intro/iec61499.adoc) just as Podcast.
