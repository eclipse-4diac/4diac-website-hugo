    - Added helper for type declaration parsing.
    - Improved regex handling for variable bounds.

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed infinite recursion for subapp connections in monitoring.
  - Corrected copy/paste behavior for types with the same name from different packages.
  - Fixed issues pasting into empty NatTable.

- **Improvements in NatTable**
  - Changed copy/paste behavior for rows to handle imports.

- **External Source Handling**
  - Warnings are now ignored by default in external source folders.

- **Coordinate System Updates**
  - Reworked collision and size calculations to align with IEC 61499 coordinates.

- **Struct Muxer Improvements**
  - Ensured no additional padding, maintaining proper grid alignment.

- **Variable View Enhancements**
  - Improved variable value editing:
    - Added shortcuts to change variable values.

    - Introduced a manager for listening to qualified name changes.
    - Implemented support for updating the plant hierarchy with qualified name changes.

- **Collision Detection**
  - Correctly handled right interface bar collisions in expanded subapps.

- **Memory Boundary Settings**
  - Removed outdated memory boundary settings for better compatibility with modern JVMs.


## Eclipse 4diac FORTE Updates

- **Struct Support Enhancements**
  - Refactored connection closing to support nested structs.
  - Refactored `setMemberValues` for nested struct compatibility.
  - Refactored `getRDBufferIndexFromNodeId` for nested structs.
  - Refactored initialization of `RDBuffer` to support nested structs.
  - Added support for sending data with nested structs.
  - Organized nested struct members in a new struct action info.
