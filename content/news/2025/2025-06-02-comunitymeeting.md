 - We aim to present recent changes in the Eclipse 4diac environment and project team.
 - We will demonstrate notable features and provide tips and tricks.
 - Our committer JÃ¶rg Walter will present his recent work on using the build environment to facilitate creating your own 4diac FORTE.
 - Following up on initial insights in our previous community evening, our committer Martin Jobst will present the new Structured Text editor, which has excellent editing capabilities that resemble those available for general-purpose programming languages. The sophisticated features can greatly reduce engineering time.
 - We will have enough time for questions and comments from the audience.

Find the details and the Zoom link at our [virtual community events page](/4diac/events/virt-community/)
