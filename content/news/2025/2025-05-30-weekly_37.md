  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from May 23 to May 30, 2025.
  
  This week's Eclipse 4diac updates bring improvements to 4diac IDE including 
  support for FunctionFBType in the FB Network interpreter, significant improvements to the Structured Text editor, and smarter monitoring and bulk editing features.
  On 4diac FORTE side the improvements are to store type hashes for FBs, data types, and adapters, streamlined build support with fixes for string escapes and improved CI integration, and a more flexible Generic FB architecture.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **FBNetwork Interpreter Support for `FunctionFBType`**

- **Structured Text (ST) Editor Enhancements:**
  - Correct handling of parameters with variable-length arrays.
  - Improved escaping of newline characters (e.g., `\n` now maps to `$L` instead of `$N`).
  - Restructured preferences and property pages:
    - Unified layout across ST-related settings.
    - Removed obsolete ST core and Xtext compiler pages.
    - Project-specific configuration support.

- **Monitoring and Debugging Fixes:**
  - Improved in-out pin handling in watch views for variable-length arrays.
  - Fixed StackOverflow error for SubApps with self-loops.

- **Bulk Editor Improvements:**
  - Enhanced Application search accuracy.
  - Added status indicators and warnings for dirty editors.
  - Support for change tracking from other open editors via `TypeEntryAdapter`.
  - Option to exclude Linked Elements from searches.
  - `FindEditor` now returns all matching editors instead of just the first.

- **General Fixes and Improvements:**
  - Type hashes for FBs and data types are now exported.
  - Fixed block margin settings in project-specific configurations.
  - Improved behavior of `MarkPredecessor` in context menus.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Type Hash-Based Query and Validation:**
  - Introduced type hash validation during FB Type creation.
  - Added new query commands for Adapter Types, Data Types, and FB Types.
  - All query commands optionally support type hash verification for improved integrity.

- **Runtime and Type Library Updates:**
  - Type entries cleaned and optimized:
    - Removed virtual inheritance.
    - Introduced `constexpr` where applicable.
  - Reworked type library to use STL:
    - More type-safe.
    - Better encapsulation.

- **Generic FB (GEN FB) Improvements:**
  - Delegated pin creation to subclasses.
  - `CommFB` and `RT_Bridge` reworked to match new GEN FB concept.
  - **Note:** Adapter support is temporarily broken and will be addressed in a follow-up update.

- **Build System and CI Enhancements:**
  - Introduced standardized CMake presets for CI builds.
  - Added timeouts to C library tests to avoid stalled builds.
  - Enabled verbose test output in GitHub CI runs.

- **Cleanups and Legacy Removal:**
  - Removed `SinglyListLink` from OPC UA layer.
  - Deprecated build options removed:
    - `FORTE_USE_WSTRING_DATATYPE`
    - `FORTE_UNICODE_SUPPORT`


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
