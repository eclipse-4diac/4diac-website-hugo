  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from July 18 to July 25, 2025.
  
  This week's development work focused on improving editor behavior, refining code through cleanup and refactoring, and extending functionality across both 4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE. 
  Several enhancements were made to avoid unnecessary reloads in editors, simplify test infrastructure, and introduce new function blocks. 
  4diac FORTE saw continued work on OPC UA integration and function block consistency, along with the removal of legacy configuration options and build system improvements.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Editor Reliability and Synchronization**
  - Postpone navigation location updates of the type entry adapter to part activation to avoid wrong editor activation.
  - Moved bulk editor reload checks to the same infrastructure as editor activation handling.
  - Avoid triggering false editor reloads when a type is first loaded by checking if the type was actually reloaded.

- **Initial Value Editing**
  - Use empty values instead of placeholders like "computing" or "too large" when editing initial values.

- **Code Cleanup**
  - Remove unused methods in `FBNetworkImporter`.
  - Delete unused error marker resolver.
  - Fix SonarLint issues and clean up code in Bulk Editor.

- **Refactoring Enhancements**
  - Consider unused imports in related resources during refactoring.
  - Automatically remove unused imports when moving types within the same package.

- **Testing and Build Improvements**
  - Combine trivial parameterized tests into simpler forms to reduce build output and improve build times.

- **Function Block Extensions**
  - Add generic `SEND_RECV` communication block for duplex communication.
  - Add `F_ANY_AS_STRING` function block.

- **Other Fixes**
  - Prevent `IdentifierVerifier` from allowing dots in identifiers.
  - Provide extension providers for resource, device, and segment types.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Function Block and Interface Updates**
  - Update description of `FORTE_QD` to clarify it provides access to double word (QD) physical outputs.
  - Add access to digital inputs via index for greater flexibility.
  - Rename data input prefix from `IN_` to `IN` for consistency.
  - Configure default event type of `E_TRIG` to `EInit`.

- **OPC UA Improvements**
  - Add input arguments to OPC UA device manager query methods.
  - Add methods to query FB types, data types, and global constant types.
  - Remove `-forte_[PORT]` suffix from custom OPC UA server hostnames.
  - Make OPC UA alarm messages and severity levels configurable.
  - Fix issue with re-creating existing alarm types after redeployment.

- **Build and Configuration Updates**
  - Remove obsolete CMake option `FORTE_SUPPORT_MONITORING`.
  - Enable system tests in the multi-platform CMake workflow.
  - Improve string escaping in CMake arguments and disable `SimpleMultiTest` on Windows.

- **Code Cleanup and Maintenance**
  - Refactor and clean up the A&C layer.
  - Adjust formatting in `evt_REQ` event handler methods.
  - Fix typo in a comment (replacing "AND" with "ADD").
  - Only update any-source connections if the destination is not any.
  - Use proper template types to avoid assignment mismatches.

Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
