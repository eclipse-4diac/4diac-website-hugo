## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Maintenance release**
  - Released **4diac IDE 3.0.1**, focusing on bug fixes for the 3.0 release.

- **Data handling and libraries**
  - Corrected byte assembly logic to properly assemble four bytes into a DWORD.
  - Added support for splitting a DWORD into individual bytes, improving low-level data manipulation utilities.
  - Updated copyright and versioning information for the affected functions.

- **Graphical editing and scaling**
  - Fixed handling of zoom and scaling when adjusting bendpoints, improving behavior on HiDPI systems (#1978).
  - Corrected FB insert positioning to properly account for parent scaling.
  - Reworked `SetPositionCommand` to rely on correctly translated GEF constraints and better handle screen resolution.

- **Exporter and operations**
  - Refactored the exporter infrastructure by removing the no-longer-needed abstract exporter.
  - Improved progress handling by using sub-monitors to properly react to cancelled operations.

- **ST editor stability and correctness**
  - Fixed invalid generic type creation in the “missing variable” quickfix, falling back to compatible concrete types.
  - Prevented null pointer exceptions when handling incompatible types in the ST editor.

- **Internationalization and UI polish**
  - Exported additional translatable strings and explicitly marked non-translatable ones.
  - Updated the splash screen to version 3.0.1.
  - Synced bundled documentation with the latest upstream fixes.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Function library enhancements**
  - Added `SPLIT_DWORD_INTO_BYTES` to complement existing byte assembly functionality.
  - Corrected documentation for `ASSELE_DWORD_FROM_BYTES` to reflect the correct byte count.
  - Aligned internal logic and interface declarations for consistency.

- **OPC UA improvements**
  - Cleaned up the query type implementation in the OPC UA manager for clearer and more robust behavior.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac Documentation

- **OPC UA deployment**
  - Added new documentation describing OPC UA deployment.
  - Updated tutorials to reference the new OPC UA deployment documentation.

- **General fixes**
  - Corrected a broken GitHub access token hyperlink.


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
