  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from October 10 to October 17, 2025.
  
  This week’s updates continue the refinement of the new 4diac 3.0 infrastructure, with improvements in editor robustness, refactoring of generic function blocks, and expanded platform support.  
  The 4diac IDE received many model and UI stabilizations, while 4diac FORTE introduced new generic function blocks and modernized internal code structures.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Stability and robustness improvements**  
  - Hardened multiple UI components such as `ZoomComboContributionItem`, `DiagramOutlinePage`, and various editors against race conditions and out-of-order refreshes  
  - Added error-page handling and recovery for failed type or system editor loading, including a new **Open Text Editor** button for error situations  
  - Fixed issues such as incorrect pin names for error markers, NPEs in templates without manifests, and crashes in label providers or refactor testers  
  - Improved operation history handling to prevent missing post-execute events when the history is full  
  - Ensured proper nature validation when project files change and fixed color rendering for error/warning cells in the NatTable editor  

- **Model and importer updates**  
  - Introduced and refined **generic function blocks**, including `E_MERGE`, `E_SPLIT`, `F_SEL_E`, and `F_MUX` variants, simplifying reuse and consistency  
  - Added and standardized the new `GenericClassName` attribute for identifying generic FBs such as MUX and SEL types  
  - Updated F_SEL_E function blocks to standardize event names for better alignment across the typelibrary  
  - Fixed search in subapplications to include connection attributes  
  - Improved refactoring and dependency handling by avoiding redundant reloads and updates to mapped resources  
  - Updated library management to ensure new libraries are properly registered and visible in the type system  
  - Enhanced type validation and import handling, fixing struct rename propagation and unqualified lookup issues  
  - Improved handling of missing compiler info and multi-dimensional InOut array export in forte_ng  

- **User experience and visual updates**  
  - Added file path display to the “Open Type” dialog and updated comment formatting  
  - Introduced a **dedicated global constant icon** as part of the first SVG-based scalable icon set in 4diac  
  - Updated and cleaned project structure by removing obsolete manifest conversion logic and redundant libraries  
  - Added the **first splash screen design for the upcoming 3.0 release**


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Generic function block unification**  
  - Introduced **generic versions** of selection (`GEN_F_SEL_E`), multiplex (`GEN_F_MUX`), and event merge (`GEN_E_MERGE`) function blocks  
    - Simplifies the function block library and supports variable input configurations determined at runtime  
    - Removed obsolete, specific FB variants such as `F_SEL_E_2`, `F_SEL_E_3`, and `F_MUX_2`  

- **Code modernization and cleanup**  
  - Replaced traditional include guards with `#pragma once` across the codebase for improved clarity and compilation efficiency  
  - Fixed use-after-free in struct member com layer, improved event queue logging, and replaced internal list implementations for better memory safety  
  - Fixed compiler and build issues such as unsupported CXX flags, missing options, and Windows-specific constexpr problems  
  - Treated warnings as errors in CI builds to enforce stricter code quality  
  - Added namespace corrections for modules like MQTT Paho and improved overall logging consistency  
  - Adopted updated FreeRTOS integration for 4diac FORTE 3.0.0  

- **Execution and runtime updates**  
  - Introduced fixed bitsets for managing force flags, allowing configurable limits for forced data pins  
  - Ensured forced outputs are reset after each event execution  
  - Updated RPATH handling in CMake presets for more predictable installation behavior



Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
