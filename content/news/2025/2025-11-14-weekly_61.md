  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from November 07 to November 14, 2025.
  
  This week brings improvements across all Eclipse 4diac main components — 4diac IDE, 4diac FORTE, and 4diac FBE — with a strong focus on robustness, correctness, and smoother developer workflows.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Enhancements to type library handling**
  - Added name references for entries of referenced type libraries.
  - Added notifications for changes to referenced type library entries.
  - Added referenced projects to the type library.
  - Improved handling of **concurrent updates** in the type library manager.
  - Avoided creating or deleting markers for **foreign projects**.

- **Refactoring, importing, and version handling**
  - Fixed invalid thread access that occurred when saving editors during refactoring.
  - Improved matching of **version ranges** in 4diac FORTE export by switching to `AnyNewerVersion` compatibility for CMake.
  - Improved lookup of **unqualified data types**, now correctly falling back to imports and defaulting `null` to `ANY`.
  - Avoided unnecessary pin updates for configurable types during datatype refactorings.

- **Execution and interpretation fixes**
  - Added `ServiceInterfaceFBTypeRuntime` to the network interpreter to avoid exceptions when SI FBs appear in networks.
  - Fixed missing link between events and instances in generated network traces.

- **Interface and annotation correctness**
  - Fixed handling of **With** changes so that interface modifications now trigger proper type updates (#1815).
  - Corrected placement of **watchpoint annotations** on FB instances.
  - Hardened shutdown logic to avoid selection/update notifications triggering errors on Linux (#1808).

- **General improvements**
  - LibraryBuilder now properly reports removed links and exports all strings.
  - Harmonized plugin versions for the FB interpreter design component.
  - Cleaned up various command implementations.



## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Structured Text (ST) improvements**
  - Fixed output parameter handling in ST event accessors.
  - Corrected ST output assignment behavior involving generic types.
  - Added type traits and concepts for generic data types.

- **Function Block behavior fixes**
  - Corrected the transition in `E_TON` to ensure the proper event (`EO0`) fires when `R` is triggered.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FBE

- **Build and tooling updates for 3.0**
  - Updated 4diac FORTE and 4diac toolchain for the 3.0 release.
  - Improved warning visibility in `compile.sh` and enabled SSL certificate verification.
  - Multiple portability fixes for Windows and macOS (libpcap, openpowerlink, paho.mqtt.c, libmodbus).

- **Configuration and packaging improvements**
  - Switched debug config to `RelWithDebInfo`.
  - Reduced Windows executable size.
  - Improved handling of toolchain folders, presets, and compdb.
  - Added support for multiple IO modules and pre-downloaded file detection.
  - Improved dynamic link bundling and installer robustness.

- **Module and recipe updates**
  - Removed obsolete features, added a new module example.
  - Added BaseX recipe for XQueryClient.
  - Updated numerous dependencies and libraries:
    - libmodbus → v3.1.11  
    - libpcap → v1.10.5  
    - libressl → v4.2.0  
    - paho.mqtt.c → v1.3.15  
    - boost → v1.89.0  
    - bzip2 → updated & new download location  
    - open62541 → 1.4.14  

- **Miscellaneous**
  - Updated build recipes, tests, placeholders, and configuration files.
  - Improved logging, messaging, and portability across scripts and build tools.

Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
