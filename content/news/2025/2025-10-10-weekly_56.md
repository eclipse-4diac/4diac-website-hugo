## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **General robustness and cleanup**  
  - Hardened disposal of `DiagramOutlinePage` to ensure proper listener cleanup  
  - Made `TypeDecorator`’s editor lookup more defensive  
  - Reworked ANT task generation to properly handle out-of-tree builds  
  - Reformatted all XML files to match current 4diac IDE formatting conventions  
  - Removed `DOCTYPE` declarations from XML templates and libraries to simplify structure and improve parsing performance and security  

- **Importer and model improvements**  
  - Added implicit imports and improved import resolution in the importer  
  - Extracted interface list and block type importer from FBT importer  
  - Updated documentation and `toc.xml` to align with the new documentation structure  
  - Added a name validation check ensuring type names differ from filenames  
  - Updated model to use dedicated `validateName` for `LibraryElements`  
  - Changed array access in forte_ng export to use checked access  
  - Adjusted struct connection jumping to stop when a connection is visible  
  - Prevented errors for variable arrays when used as method parameters  


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Platform and build improvements**  
  - Added extern template declarations for factories and registries to reduce shared library size and avoid Windows linker issues  
  - Used explicit string ID interning on Windows to prevent template duplication across DLLs  
  - Avoided `constinit` initialization of `std::mutex` for better FreeRTOS and MinGW compatibility  
  - Added load options for Win32 and POSIX builds  
  - Updated `WHOLE_ARCHIVE` support message to match modern CMake wording  

- **OPC UA support**  
  - Reworked OP UA Alarms & Condition Layer to correctly handle the `AckedState`  

- **Code quality and reliability**  
  - Added improved array bounds checks that report both index and bounds  
  - Upgraded RevolutionPi module to new namespaces
