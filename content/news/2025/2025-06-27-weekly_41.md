  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from June 20 to June 27, 2025.
  
  This week in Eclipse 4diac: 4diac IDE received updates to the external library handling, improved SubApp support in the Bulk Editor, and better drag-and-drop behavior in the System Explorer. The connection layout algorithm now supports user-defined timeouts and considers comment fields during routing. In 4diac FORTE, clang-format integration was added along with fixes for debug-level logging in IEC 61131-3 function blocks.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Library Handling Overhaul**
  - Introduced a new builder for external libraries.
  - Removed outdated components: library change listener, plugin activator, TypeLibraryStarter extension point, and event broker.
  - Added marker resolution to assist users in adding the new builder when needed.
  - Adjusted existing tests to reflect the updated library handling approach.

- **Deployment & Package Name Fixes**
  - Corrected package names in several contexts:
    - `EMB_RES` in device creation and deployment evaluation.
    - `FORTE_PC` in deployment evaluation.
    - `E_RESTART` in EMB_RES for version 3.0.0.

- **System Explorer Enhancements**
  - Improved drag-and-drop behavior:
    - Files can now be dragged between different 4diac IDE instances [#1285](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-ide/issues/1285).
    - Non-IEC 61499 files are now supported.

- **Bulk Editor and SubApp Improvements**
  - Introduced option to open BulkEditor with pre-selected SubApps as scope.
  - Added "Collapse all" and "Expand all" buttons to the SubApp hierarchy selection dialog.
  - Display text for selected hierarchies and restored initial selections for better usability.
  - Added a new SubApp-hierarchy scope option for the BulkEditor.

- **Connection Layout Enhancements**
  - Added user-configurable timeout for the connection layout algorithm to better support large or complex networks.
  - Comments are now included as nodes in the layout graph to improve connection routing.

- **Model Handling & Refactoring**
  - Switched model search internals to use `Map<EObject>` for improved efficiency.
  - Cached type entries in refactoring commands to avoid URI-related errors during move operations.

- **Other Fixes and Improvements**
  - Fixed issue with multiple file moves not updating instances properly.
  - Fixed unescaped quotes in string value converter.
  - Upgraded Eclipse ELK to the 0.10.0 release.
  - Build and Plugin Management
    - Fixed missing version for `build-helper-maven-plugin` to ensure proper Tycho build support.
    - Moved user-visible strings to `plugin.properties` for better internationalization.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Code Quality and Formatting**
  - Added a GitHub workflow with `clang-format` to enforce coding style.
  - Reformatted the entire codebase to match `clang-format` rules.

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed a compile error in the IEC 61131-3 package when using debug log level:
    - Updated `genbitbase_fbt` and `GEN_ADD_fbt` to use the correct DEVLOG_DEBUG interface.

- **Documentation**
  - Improved the `README.md` for better clarity and project onboarding.


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
