  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from June 13 to June 20, 2025.
  
  This week's updates brings major enhancements to the function block interface specification and composite FB support, aligning both 4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE with modern concepts like spans and structured data handling. 
  In addition, the 4diac IDE sees numerous usability improvements in the Bulk Editor, better deployment tooling, and updated exporters for seamless integration with 4diac FORTE.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Communication & Deployment**
  - Added `Client_3_2` for HTTP communication to:
  - Enhanced deployment interactor:
    - Added query support for FB and data types
    - Type queries now use fully qualified names
    - Added FB type to deployment responses
    - Use `TypeHash` for better type identification
    - Introduced `TypeHash` attribute in the type library

- **Export & Code Generation**
  - Fixed missing type hash in `forte_ng` export for functions
  - Improved `forte_ng` export:
    - Fixed composite FB and adapter export
  - Updated exporters to new 4diac FORTE concepts:
    - CFB network data
    - Variable internals
    - FB interface spec ([#392](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-forte/issues/392))

- **Interpreter Enhancements**
  - Fixed setting input variables
  - Preserved internal FB state across execution

- **Usability and UX Enhancements**
  - Overhauled Bulk Editor:
    - Added sorting, filtering, collapsing, and clearing filters
    - Introduced editable column changes and better naming
    - Left truncation via new `TextPainter`
    - Improved memento handling and image disposal
  - Improved `VarConfig` search (preparation for editing unsaved configs)
  - Extracted NatTable from BulkEditor into a separate class

- **General Fixes and Code Cleanups**
  - Fixed:
    - Allowing dots in `IdentifierVerifier`
    - `isTypeEditable` for `InterfaceElements` with `null` networks (e.g., structs)
  - Removed:
    - Redundant action handler settings in multi-page editor
    - Duplicate application command bindings
  - Replaced Guice `Object` class with `java.util.Object`
  - Handled file move/rename in participants
  - Upgraded all dependencies to Eclipse 2025-06


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Composite and Interface Specification Overhaul**
  - Major interface spec rework ([#392](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-forte/issues/392)):
    - Secured and modernized FB interface specs using modern C++
    - Updated internal var handling to match the new spec
    - Cleaned and upgraded Composite FB data structures
      - Switched to spans and `std::array`
      - Removed unused internal FB/param data

- **Code Modernization**
  - Moved `getSDx(void*, int)` to base class
  - Refactored (dis)connect to accept paths
  - Used `std::span`:
    - For FB creation/deletion in containers
    - For retrieving connections by name

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed out-of-bounds access in `CFBContainer::getFB`
  - Added support for gathering delegate connections


Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
