Why should you care about IEC 61499? Because it revolutionizes how we design distributed control systems by offering modular, reusable components that seamlessly integrate into various environments. 
Imagine developing a smart factory system where machines communicate efficiently and adapt to changes in real-time.

With [4diac IDE](/4diac/4diac_ide), you’ll not only model these systems but also simulate, test, and deploy them effectively. 
Ever wondered how to manage complex industrial processes with minimal downtime? 
This event demonstrates how IEC 61499’s event-driven architecture ensures optimal performance and resource utilization.

Participants will dive into hands-on workshops that make theory tangible. For instance, you’ll learn to connect [4diac FORTE](/4diac/4diac_forte) to [Factory IO](https://factoryio.com/), simulating real-world scenarios. 
The workshops cater to both newcomers and seasoned professionals, ensuring everyone walks away with actionable insights.

Why limit your system’s capabilities when you can extend the [4diac IDE](/4diac/4diac_ide) and [4diac FORTE](/4diac/4diac_forte) to suit your project’s unique needs? 
Attendees will gain the skills to customize these tools, enhancing their application’s scalability and functionality.

Networking with Eclipse 4diac committers offers unparalleled opportunities to learn from the creators and contributors shaping the future of distributed control. 
Their industry usage reports will reveal how leading companies implement IEC 61499 for enhanced efficiency.

Whether you're a researcher or a practitioner in industrial automation, this Winter School bridges the gap between academic concepts and practical applications, enabling you to stay ahead in your field.
