A major focus of this release is improved behavior on **modern and high-DPI display setups**. Several issues affecting zooming, scaling, and positioning in graphical editors have been resolved, resulting in more predictable editing behavior across platforms.

The **Structured Text** editor has also been stabilized with fixes that prevent invalid code generation and improve robustness when working with incompatible types.

In addition, this release addresses a number of **model consistency and UI robustness issues**, including more reliable adapter type handling, improved editor lifecycle management, and better behavior in edge cases across debugging and table-based views.

4diac IDE 3.0.1 is a recommended update for all users of the 3.0.x series. **Users of 4diac IDE 3.0.0 can simply update their installation using the built-in update mechanism.**

For a detailed overview of user-visible changes, see the
[New & Noteworthy](/4diac/new-and-noteworthy/3.0.1/) page for this release.
