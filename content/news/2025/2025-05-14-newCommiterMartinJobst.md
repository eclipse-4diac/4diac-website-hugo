Martin is a freelance computer scientist from Germany, with nearly a decade of experience contributing to Eclipse 4diac. His expertise spans low-level embedded development, distributed systems, model-based engineering, compiler design, databases, and network security.

His major contributions to Eclipse 4diac include:
- The implementation of large parts of the **IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) editor**
- Development of the **integrated debugging environment** for IEC 61499 function blocks
- Work on the **exporter, deployment, and monitoring infrastructure** for the FORTE runtime
- Enhancements to the **core classes and data types** in FORTE

These features are all available in the current **4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE 3.0 early access**, and we encourage the community to explore and provide feedback.

Please join us in congratulating Martin and feel free to reach out to him with questions, comments, or collaboration ideas.

Welcome aboard, Martin!
