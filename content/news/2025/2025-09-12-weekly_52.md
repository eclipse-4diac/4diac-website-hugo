## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Editor Improvements**
  - Fixed issues with the "Change Type" dialog, including type changes between FB and SubApp.
  - Fixed undo context matching in the Xtext type editor and improved handling of embedded editors.
  - Cleaned command stack handling for multipage editors and reduced unnecessary dirty property notifications.
  - Added exception check when saving in `AbstractTypeEditor`.
  - Fixed index and display issues in VarConfigs and ST code references.
- **Command Stack Refactoring**
  - Introduced `OperationHistoryCommandStack` and `LibraryElementUndoContext` for consistent undo/redo across graphical and type editors.
  - Removed outdated `getSystem` method from editors and eliminated the `CommandStack` from the AutomationSystem.
  - Updated type and library element handling with `TypeEntryDataHandler` using `EObjects`.
- **Features & Enhancements**
  - Added support for package names in resource types in deployment using `::` separator.
  - Improved attribute handling: inherit attributes can now be defined, copied on instance creation, and trigger warnings instead of errors.
  - Added manifest download support to `IArchiveDownloader` for faster dependency resolution.
  - Reworked generation of `CMakeLists.txt` and export structure for `forte_ng`.
- **Build & Platform Updates**
  - Upgraded build system to Tycho 5.0.
  - Removed deprecated GEF Classic source features from the target platform.
  - Fixed compliance with stricter Java rules.
  - Added helper utilities for library element, file, and project access.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Build System & Options**
  - Set minimum CMake version to 3.30 and defined C++ standard via target compile features.
  - Reworked options: `FORTE_STACKTRACE`, `FORTE_LOGLEVEL`, and `FORTE_RTTI_AND_EXCEPTIONS`.
  - Updated CMake project options and added dependency checks.
  - Removed `forte-global` target and `typeinit`.
  - Removed overrides for `operator new`/`delete` in favor of standard operators.
- **Architecture & Code Structure**
  - Reorganized source and include file structure across core, arch, stdfblib, modules, and com layers.
  - Added explicit namespaces to modules and stdfblib.
  - Added dependencies between libraries for cleaner build organization.
- **Features & Fixes**
  - Added support for generic FBs with packages in typelib.
  - Fixed issues in OPC UA integration: includes, string ID concatenation, error messages, and redundant architecture definitions.
  - Reworked OPC UA nodesets and types to use self-registration.
  - Fixed and improved CTF tracing and replay.
  - Updated type names across tests, systemtests, modules, and stdfblib.
  - Hidden resource internals for better encapsulation.
  - Added findTabs ignore file.
