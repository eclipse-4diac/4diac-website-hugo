  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from August 1 to August 8, 2025.
  
  This round of updates focuses on enhancing the user experience in the 4diac IDE's graphical editor—especially when dragging and resizing blocks—and improving test reliability in 4diac FORTE. Highlights include better collision feedback and robust test behavior in release builds.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Working Sets Support**
  - Fixed the Bulk Editor to open correctly when using working sets.

- **Graphical Editor Enhancements**
  - Improved feedback when resizing blocks:
    - A **margin-border** is now shown for function blocks during resize.
  - Improved block movement behavior:
    - Moving blocks with cloning active is now correctly handled.
  - Added **ghost figures** when dragging blocks to visualize movement.
  - Collision feedback was improved:
    - A **color change** indicates when dragged elements would collide.
    - **Figures with margin** now show potential collisions while dragging.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Test Reliability**
  - Fixed tests to work correctly in **Release mode** by replacing `BOOST_ASSERT` (which is disabled in Release builds) with `BOOST_REQUIRE`, ensuring that side effects and conditions are still verified.



Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
