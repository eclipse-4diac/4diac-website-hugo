## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Type & Instance Handling**
  - Fixed drag-and-drop creation of typed subapp instances (#1917).  
  - Disabled `RenameElement` for FCT and added selection feedback for InterfaceElements in the FCT TypeEditor.  
  - Added filtering of own type in NewInstanceEditor and removed TSA usage inside CFBs.  
  - Added checks preventing insertion of TSA into CFBs and fixed self-insertion handling.  
  - Fixed creation of duplicate ConfigurableFB-specific attributes.  
  - Fixed handling of missing configurable FB types and preserved attributes when updating FBs coming from error markers.  
  - Corrected special handling of FBs by checking package names to avoid false matches.

- **Editor, UI & Property Improvements**
  - Added “Go To Attribute” support for markers in typed subapp networks.  
  - Restored composite type network traces.  
  - Added TypeHash attributes to adapter types (ATimeOut, ARTimeOut).  
  - Improved attribute visibility: refresh on undo/redo, hide/show commands, and correct updates of visibility tables.  
  - Basic setup for member-access pin configuration in `F_MOVE`.  
  - Updated preference pages to avoid unnecessary FieldEditor pages.

- **Search & Navigation**
  - Added search-pin reference handler, moved it to search plugin, and enabled single-file search in ModelSearch.

- **Deployment & Export**
  - Refactored OPC UA deployment response handling.  
  - Updated export builder with improved error reporting, incremental build support, full build option, case-insensitive extension checks, and reorganized property pages.  
  - Moved type export property page to the 4diac category.  
  - Fixed updating of type entries during rename quickfixes.

- **Drag & Drop & Network Behavior**
  - Disabled adapter creation via drag & drop in all FB networks (#1845).  
  - Cleaned up DnD handling to prevent broken networks.

- **Quickfixes & Refactoring**
  - Improved rename quickfixes.  
  - Removed automatic type renaming in favor of explicit quickfixes.  
  - Cleaned up `FordiacResourceChangeListener`.  
  - Improved handling of type/file name mismatches.

- **Miscellaneous**
  - Removed LUA exporter from UI (#809).  
  - Added commands for showing/hiding member access pins.  
  - Ensured correct refresh of member access property sheets on visibility changes.



## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **OPC UA Deployment**
  - Refactored query methods to use response status correctly.  
  - Fixed errors in `QueryDataType` handling.

- **Communication Layers & Modules**
  - Ported the CAN layer to the new communication factory.  
  - Fixed missing installation commands in CMake for several communication modules (CAN, HTTP, Modbus, MQTT-Paho, OPC, TSN, XQuery).
