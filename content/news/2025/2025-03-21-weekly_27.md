## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **I/O Function Block (FB) Improvements:**
  - Moved interface specifications of I/O FBs into a base class template.
  - Moved event functions to I/O FB base classes to reduce code duplication.
  - Added templates for input and output FBs to streamline code.
  - Reworked `CProcessInterfaceFB` to avoid using a mutex.

  - Reverted incorrect code in Embrick FBs.

- **Execution and State Management Enhancements:**
  - Reworked `CProcessInterfaceFB::changeExecutionState` for better state handling.
  - Fixed deregistration logic and added state change method in modular process interface.
