## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Improved validation and error handling**
  - Validation now only runs on **opened projects**, avoiding unnecessary checks.  
  - Prevented **follow-up errors** caused by missing types or instances.  
  - Fixed **null pointer exceptions** in connection handling and deployment data computation.  
  - Stabilized type hashing by preserving the **order of “With” elements**, ensuring deterministic results.  
  - Avoided creating error marker elements for **missing types** to reduce visual clutter.  

- **Enhanced type and annotation management**
  - Added **TypeHash attributes** to the type library for consistent type identification.  
  - Fixed the **InterfaceImporter** to correctly parse only the first interface.  
  - Improved **dynamic contract checker** error messages for clarity.  
  - **Type annotations** are now shown directly on Function Block (FB) figures.  
  - Removed fixed red borders around error pins for a cleaner look.  

- **Structured Text and global constant improvements**
  - Introduced a **GlobalConstantsMatcher** to validate references inside ST code.  
  - Fixed export of **generic types** and adapter type names in `forte_ng` export.  

- **User interface and project usability**
  - Added a **filter to hide closed projects** in the System Explorer.  
  - Fixed the **log helper** to correctly reset its single window flag, preventing blocked dialogs.  
  - Updated the “**What’s New**” page for the **4diac 3.0 release**, refreshed RSS feed links, and fixed about dialog dates.  



## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Cleanup and modernization**
  - Removed obsolete **ESP32-specific toolchain files** and setup scripts.  
  - Removed deprecated **LocalizedText2LocalizedText FB** (use `F_MOVE` instead).  

- **Improved module structure**
  - Upgraded **GPIOCHIP**, **PLC01a1**, and **XQuery** modules to the new namespace and Function Block layout for consistency and easier maintenance.  
  - Included `forte_st_util` in the **I/O configuration FB base class** for better modular integration.  

- **Logging and debugging enhancements**
  - Improved **error logging** for dropped external events — now showing the affected Function Block and event for easier debugging.  
  - Adjusted logging verbosity to make overflow messages more concise.  
  - Enabled `LOGINFO` output also in **RelWithDebInfo builds** for consistent debug visibility.  

- **Cross-platform improvements**
  - Updated **POSIX architecture support** to ensure full **MacOS compatibility**.
