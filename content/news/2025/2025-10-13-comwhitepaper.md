  The Eclipse 4diac project is not only dedicated to providing an open-source ecosystem for IEC 61499-based automation but also to continuously advancing and improving the IEC 61499 standard itself.

  As part of this ongoing effort, we are excited to share our first **Eclipse 4diac White Paper**, focusing on **improved communication modelling in IEC 61499**.

The white paper, authored by **Friederike Bruns** and **Alois Zoitl**, proposes an extension to the IEC 61499 standard introducing messages and channels as explicit modelling concepts for communication across devices. With this approach, developers can capture **timing**, **quality of service (QoS)**, and **synchronization** aspects directly in their application and system models.

By making communication a first-class modelling concept, distributed automation systems can be described more precisely, supporting **platform independence, analysis, and reconfiguration**.

This white paper is the first in a planned series that aims to document key **design and implementation decisions** within Eclipse 4diac, opening up discussions on potential extensions and refinements to IEC 61499.

We’d love to hear your feedback and ideas — join the discussion and help us shape the future of IEC 61499 communication modelling!
