  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from July 25 to August 1, 2025.
  
  The latest updates to Eclipse 4diac bring improvements to 4diac IDE's type handling, graphical editor usability, and code generation logic. 
  On the 4diac FORTE side, a powerful new communication infrastructure has been introduced, including TCP/UDP support and a generic `SEND_RECV` block.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Model Robustness and Validation Enhancements**
  - Interface elements are now required to always have a type.
  - The type of event and data pins is enforced to never be `null`, with assertions added to help catch violations.
  - InOut variable copying now assigns a temporary `ANY` type during EcoreUtil.Copier operations to avoid `null` references.
  - Fixed missing event types in evaluator tests.
  - Updated tests to reflect enforced non-null interface element types.

- **Graphical Editor Improvements**
  - Dragging of function block network elements now uses a **margin** for better collision handling.
  - Improved model size calculation for collision detection by properly considering pin ordering.
  - Scrolling during dragging now works for **Comments**, **Groups**, and **Devices** by moving `ScrollingDragTracker` to a shared superclass.

- **Import and Type Handling**
  - Imports now ignore types from variables in typed instances, since those are declared in the type itself.
  - Fixed an issue where error type entries had no URI by using the type name as a fallback.
  - Added a method to retrieve file extensions for type entries.

- **Usability and Code Improvements**
  - Struct variables are now shown in **declaration order**, improving consistency with model definitions.
  - Enhanced OPC UA executor with new **query methods**.
  - Improved call request handling by adding a **hash** and using structured responses.
  - Log messages now include **formatted types** and no longer use constant IDs.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **New Communication Infrastructure**
  - Introduced a new communication layer with:
    - support for **asynchronous and polled** operation,
    - **minimum/maximum receive size** configuration,
    - **event configuration** flexibility,
    - **type-safe** communication channels with **self-registration**.
  - Includes:
    - `raw` channel for STRING communication,
    - `null` channel for testing, usable via `raw[].null[]`.
  - Implemented **TCP and UDP communication channels** for both:
    - **POSIX** platforms,
    - **Win32** platforms.
  - Added tests for:
    - **TCP and UDP communication channels**,
    - **null communication channel**,
    - **raw channel** with fixed-size configuration.

- **SEND_RECV Block**
  - Added a new **generic `SEND_RECV` function block** for independent sending and receiving on duplex channels.

- **Build System Improvements**
  - Added **fake timer support** to the new CMake approach and fixed related errors with other fake components.
