## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Enhanced transition condition support**  
  - Added full support for transition conditions in refactoring, validation, the ST resource, and the builder  
  - Displayed warnings and error overlays directly on transitions, including tooltips with diagnostic messages  

- **Annotation model performance and responsiveness**  
  - Optimized annotation event handling for faster access and UI updates  
  - Moved annotation updates to background jobs and dispatched UI events asynchronously for better responsiveness  
  - Avoided full reloads of the annotation model on save by using incremental refreshes  

- **Export and dependency management**  
  - Added support for version ranges in forte_ng dependency exports  
  - Included the exporter version in generated FORTE files  
  - Fixed issues in the export builder for files without extensions and ensured export works even with no exported types  
  - Avoided `find_package` for all-in-one builds in forte_ng export  
  - Converted hash values to string literals when exporting to SIFBs  

- **Usability and editor improvements**  
  - Added a **Search References of VarDecl** button to NAT tables  
  - Added “(un)check all interface elements” for tables with constraints  
  - Fixed automatic FB insertion into empty subapps and corrected target behavior in insert commands  
  - Corrected adapter FB variable names in composite FBs  
  - Changed VarConfig sections to be non-editable in composite FBs  
  - Added missing resource relocation strategies for ST algorithms  

- **Version and compliance updates**  
  - Reordered type version info in XML and editor labels to comply with IEC 61499-2 (newest version first)  
  - Added logic to ensure newly created version entries always appear first  

- **Additional fixes and maintenance**  
  - Fixed watch annotation updates in FB network edit parts  
  - Moved **F_MOVE** to the IEC 61131-3 library selection and adjusted class naming conventions  
  - Integrated new **CLIENT_0_1** and **CLIENT_1_0** OPC UA client blocks for easy single-value access  


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Code and module organization**  
  - Moved all timer-related function blocks (`E_CYCLE`, `E_PULSE`, `Blink`, etc.) into a dedicated **timers** subdirectory and namespace  
  - Refactored timer FB implementations for clarity and consistency  
  - Removed the **outdated ROS module** (targeted ROS 1) and **ESP32 module**
  - Upgraded the **Modbus** layer to new namespaces and cleaned up include paths and compiler settings  

- **Portability and architecture improvements**  
  - Added **shared library builds** to CMake presets  
  - Replaced `FORTE_ARCHITECTURE` guards with CMake-standard conditions and explicit error messages where needed  
  - Removed explicit `FORTE_ARCHITECTURE` from presets and adopted CMake system names as default architectures  
  - Added alternate architecture naming support and ensured proper handling of empty include directories  
  - Switched Windows builds to plain `GetAddrInfo` API for **Windows XP compatibility**  

- **Maintenance and compatibility**  
  - Improved **termios** handling on POSIX by reusing existing settings for cleaner and safer serial configuration  
  - Allowed the use of **installed Modbus libraries** via prefixed includes  
  - Added missing includes for **FreeRTOS** networking  
  - Fixed **namespaces and includes** for the TSN layer and ensured clang compatibility  

- **General cleanup**  
  - Fixed minor coding rule issues in serial parameter handling (`SSerialParameters`)  
  - Moved **F_MOVE** to the IEC 61131-3 selection and aligned naming conventions
