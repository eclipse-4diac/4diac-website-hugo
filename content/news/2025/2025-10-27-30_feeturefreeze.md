Over this period, we’ve seen more than **5800 commits in 4diac IDE** and **1400 commits in 4diac FORTE** — a tremendous community effort to modernize, optimize, and extend the capabilities of Eclipse 4diac.

With the feature freeze in place, our focus now shifts to **stabilization and polishing** to ensure a solid and reliable 3.0 release, planned for about three weeks from now.
