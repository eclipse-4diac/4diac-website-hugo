  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from April 18 to April 25, 2025.
  
  This week's Eclipse 4diac updates include improvements to the 4diac IDE, such as enhanced search functionality, read-only handling for libraries. In 4diac FORTE, connection handling was extensively reworked to introduce delegating connections, optimize performance, and simplify the management of connections.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Search improvements**
  - Select search results in Structured Text.
  - Switch search backend to fordiac `TextMatch`.
  - Add type information to search matches.

- **Library handling**
  - External libraries are extracted as read-only.
  - Standard libraries are made read-only through decoration.
  - Editors handle read-only behavior; library contents are protected from deletion.
  - Preparation for future `doSaveAs()` support.

- **Structured Text and Subapp improvements**
  - Add list support for `VarConfig` entries in typed Subapps.
  - Define `EInit` event type for all `INIT/INITO` events in templates.

- **Export improvements**
  - Fix: "Overwrite All" in export now writes the first file ([#1248](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-ide/issues/1248)).
  - Add Ant task logging type name and hash.
  - Small Ant task fixes for FBT and FCT separation.
  - Updated forte_ng exporter to new 4diac FORTE connection handling (see below).

- **Internal improvements**
  - Clean `UpdateFBNElementCommand`, improve multi-delete handling ([#1243](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-ide/issues/1243)).

- **Code formatting**
  - Reformat all `.h` and `.cpp` files (include file sorting disabled).

- **Connection rework**
  - Introduce delegating connection creation and deletion.
  - Use source names in connection queries and deletions.
  - Add connection wrappers and reference tracking.
  - Clean up connection lifecycle on FB, Resource, and Device deletion.
  - First version of Delegating Data Connection (negating boolean example).
  - Rework CFB connections and interface-to-internal connection handling.
  - Simplify event connections and adapter connection queries.

- **Connection optimizations**
  - Remove fanned-out connection lists.
  - Optimize output connection writes.
  - Remove `value` field in base connection classes.
  - Add separate `InOut` destination lists.
  - Improve data connection query handling.

- **FB testing and FMU improvements**
  - Rework FB test fixtures.
  - Remove connection following in FMU setup.
  - Update type libraries for connection rework.

- **Utilities and improvements**
  - Add string join utility.
  - Add equality and erase functions to `inplace_vector`.
  - Clean up OPC UA pin data type checking.
  - Remove connected checks in OPC UA and write operations.
