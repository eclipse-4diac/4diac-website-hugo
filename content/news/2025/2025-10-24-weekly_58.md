  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from October 17 to October 24, 2025.
  
  This week’s updates continue refining the stability and consistency of both 4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE.
  4diac IDE received multiple improvements around refactoring, editor synchronization, and type management, while 4diac FORTE introduced updates to generic block handling, build configuration, and testing.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Editor stability and refactoring improvements**  
  - Synchronized all Xtext editors before performing move or rename refactorings to prevent race conditions  
  - Used the open editor input for Xtext refactorings to ensure consistent state between editors  
  - Deferred handler activation until focus is gained in embedded Xtext editors to avoid premature triggers  
  - Prevented duplicate type entry adapters and redundant file notifications, reducing UI thread race conditions  
  - Avoided unnecessary resets during validation job disposal  

- **Export and model fixes**  
  - Fixed issues with FB output parameter handling and export logic in the `forte_ng` backend  
  - Corrected duplicate export of parameters and comments for in/out pins  
  - Added null checks for segment communication and improved attribute lookup to be case-insensitive  
  - Reworked function block output parameter export to align with recent FORTE updates  

- **UI and usability enhancements**  
  - Added an **InitialValueEditor** in the variable configuration section  
  - Fixed exceptions when opening the VarConfig section  
  - Improved path shortening logic in the Open Type dialog for better package name detection  
  - Added error dialogs for failed launches from shortcuts  
  - Managed bold font disposal in InfoPropertySheet to prevent resource leaks  

- **Project and validation updates**  
  - Moved 4diac project nature validation to the system manager  
  - Validated project natures automatically on startup  
  - Aborted builds on manifest errors to ensure consistent build results  
  - Allowed prototypes for launch configurations  
  - Filtered adapters and nested declarations in type references  


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Function block and type management**  
  - Reworked **function block output parameters**, aligning with recent IDE export improvements  
  - Fixed missing includes and residual references following the FB output parameter rework  
  - Corrected queries for generic type entries without configuration suffixes to improve configurability  

- **Library cleanup and maintenance**  
  - Cleaned **Convert** and **Utils** libraries by removing obsolete x2x blocks and reorganizing struct/array conversions  

- **Build and configuration updates**  
  - Added the **3.0.x branch** to GitHub workflows for CI integration  
  - Introduced explicit `--no-as-needed` linker flag on POSIX systems to restore default shared library behavior  
  - Exported compiler info to CMake presets and set cache variable types for improved build consistency  

- **Testing**  
  - Fixed references to moved or removed blocks in the test suite  



Many thanks to all contributors for their work and their feedback!
