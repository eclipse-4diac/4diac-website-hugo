  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from November 14 to November 21, 2025.
  
  This week’s Eclipse 4diac updates strengthen 4diac IDE with the new feature for member access pins, interpretation behaviour, and type handling. 
  The 4diac ecosystem also advances through refined IO-handle management in 4diac FORTE, updated documentation and 4diac FBE components.
