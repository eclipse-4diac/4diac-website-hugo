  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from August 8 to August 15, 2025.
  
  Updates from this week include support for typed Subapp deployment, more robust refactorings, enhanced collision feedback in the graphical editor, and modernization of the 4diac FORTE infrastructure using C++20 features and self-registering factories.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Typed Subapps Support**
  - Added support for deploying and evaluating typed Subapps.
  - Introduced instance property pages for typed Subapps.
  - Improved visibility configuration: In/Out pins can only be hidden for untyped Subapps.

- **Editor and Refactoring Enhancements**
  - Prevent editor reloads during refactoring to avoid race conditions.
  - Avoid redundant reload dialogs when saving modified types.
  - Introduced grouped model edits by URI for better handling of complex refactorings.
  - Fixed loss of struct MUX configuration and updates during refactoring.
  - Improved rename behavior for structured algorithm fields (no exceptions raised).
  - Fixed code folding in algorithms and methods to avoid overlapping regions.
  - Added better diagnostics for missing type loads when chaining resources.

- **Follow Connection Improvements**
  - Fixed behavior to correctly follow visible connections.
  - Simplified follow connection handlers and changed jump mode to follow all I/Os.
  - Added correct handling of jump mode and removed redundant logic.

- **Graphical Editor Enhancements**
  - Improved drag-and-drop experience:
    - Added **ghost figures**, **margin-borders**, and **color changes** to indicate collisions.
    - Fixed collision visibility when dragging over other blocks.
    - Added collision checking inside Subapps.
    - Adjusted behavior for expanded Subapps to show collisions only when size is fixed.
    - Changed color scheme for margin borders to improve visibility.

- **Type and Import Management**
  - TypeEditorInput now gracefully handles missing types by falling back to the file reference.
  - Organize imports now correctly ignores unrelated or invalid entries during refactoring.
  - Improved handling of imported types from any kind of typed instance (not just Subapps).
  - FBTypePropertyTester now uses file scanning instead of full file parsing, making it faster and more robust.
  - Added more documentation for named element annotations.

- **Deployment and Tracing**
  - Added the option to trace communication during deployment.
  - GitLab downloader now respects default-scope preferences.
  - Improved library handling:
    - Ignore invalid preferred versions,
    - Remove and re-add libraries during updates,
    - Allow force-load for specific versions.

- **Other Enhancements and Fixes**
  - Fixed attribute visibility for structured types like MUX/DEMUX.
  - Attribute target lock now has more options.
  - Avoid losing attributes when reverting to default values in runtime tab.
  - Prevent loss of trace button during merges.
  - Prevent null pointer exceptions during IDE shutdown.
  - Adjusted Ant build export to use 4diac exporter with custom copier.
  - Extended global constant search functionality.
  - Updated to Eclipse 2025-09 milestone platform.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **Factory Modernization**
  - Reworked the following to use **self-registration**:
    - ECET factory,
    - Device factory,
    - Timer handler factory.
  - Added build option to select the default factory implementation.

- **Handler and Execution Cleanup**
  - Removed unused or redundant macros and methods in `CExternalEventHandler`:
    - `get/setPriority()`, `getIdentifier()`, `DEFINE_HANDLER`.
  - Moved constructor/destructor outside of `DECLARE_HANDLER` macro.
  - Cleaned up device execution handling.

- **String ID Modernization**
  - Reworked string ID handling to use **C++20 string literal operator templates**:
    - Safer and eliminates the need for generated code.
  - Added support for fixed strings as **non-type template parameters** in anticipation of future C++ standard features ([P3094R6](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3094r6.html)).
  - Fixed and updated string ID usages across the codebase.
