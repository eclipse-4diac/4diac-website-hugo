  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from August 15 to August 22, 2025.
  
  In the past week, development on Eclipse 4diac continued with improvements in the 4diac IDEâ€™s refactoring, Structured Text editing, and the FollowConnection feature. On the 4diac FORTE side, the refactoring of the new communication infrastructure and device execution progressed further.
