  Update on what development happened across the Eclipse 4diac project in the week from May 16 to May 23, 2025.
  
  This week's Eclipse 4diac updates bring improvements to 4diac IDE including enhanced Structured Text search, refined deployment and monitoring with support for negated connections, and improved model editing and validation. 
  On 4diac FORTE side the improvements are better tracing, cleaner data handling, and streamlined build support with fixes for string escapes and improved CI integration.

## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac IDE

- **Editor and UI Enhancements**
  - Added a preference for automatic connection of event pins.
    - FBs inserted into an execution chain are now automatically connected at the end.
    - Implemented inserting function blocks after a selected predecessor.
    - "Connect Through" now works during deletion ensuring event chains.
  - Improved handling of search results in Structured Text:
    - Automatically selects search result.
    - Search now uses 4diac `TextMatch`.
    - Matches include a type indicating the editor marker.
  - Moved block margin settings into a dedicated preference page.
  - Improved project creation:
    - Standard libraries version 3.0.0 are now used by default.
    - New library packages and hardware folder introduced.

- **Deployment & Monitoring**
  - Reworked connection and initial value handling in deployment.
  - Added support for negated connections in deployment and monitoring.

- **Model Improvements**
  - Added getters in the model:
    - Interface list for interface elements.
    - FB type for interface elements.
    - Opposites for FB type and FB network element.
  - Elements from subapps are now properly saved to XML after updates.

- **Structured Text & Constants**
  - Multiple improvements and refactorings for global constants.
  - Minor factory use fix for `GlobalConstants`.

- **Validation & Contracts**
  - Added more robust validators for contracts.
  - Fixed:
    - Incorrect error reports from the validator.
    - Contract command issues with typed SubApps and undo/mapping behavior.

- **Initial Values and Types**
  - Validated initial value overrides when connected to subapp inputs.
  - Fixed literal type assignment for generic variables.
  - Supported non-finite real literals in value converters.

- **Miscellaneous**
  - Add qualified name change listener.
  - Fixed wrong algorithm execution in some cases.
  - Added ECState support for `SimpleFB`.


## Enhancements and Fixes in 4diac FORTE

- **IO Handling**
  - Improved `IODeviceController` to support `IOHandle`s without an initial direction.
  - Updated eLITeBoard support.

- **Tracing and CI**
  - Fixed various compilation issues and improved GitHub CI:
    - Added CTF trace support.
    - Corrected traced port IDs.
    - Added generated tracing files.

- **String and Character Escapes**
  - Standardized handling of escape sequences:
    - Line Feed (`$L`) and Newline (`$N`) now consistently map to `\n`.
    - Fixed inconsistencies in (W)STRING and (W)CHAR behavior.

- **Data Type Handling**
  - Added a `reset` method for setting pins to their type default values.
  - Cleaned up data type include files for better compilation performance.
  - Fixed decimal point handling in (L)REAL `toString`.
  - Unified all `toString` methods to return `std::string`.

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Replaced `CSinglyLinkedList` with `std::vector`.
  - Fixed send/receive operations.
  - Silenced C++20 deprecation warnings on MSVC.

- **Test Infrastructure**
  - Switched system tests to use the default Ubuntu image.
