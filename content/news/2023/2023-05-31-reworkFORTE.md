For 4diac FORTE, API stability was always our major concern.  
However, this came at a cost (e.g., performance, memory usage, memory-safety). 
Therefore, we decided that we need to do a major rework of 4diac FORTE for the next release! 

The first results are already looking very promising.
We get twice the speed for FB algorithm execution and reduced the runtime overhead (event and connection processing) by 30%. 
We hope for more progress to come in the next weeks.

What does that mean for you?
- For Basic, Simple, and Composite FBs; Adapter Interfaces; and Structured Data types: you simply need to regenerate the C++ code from within your IDE.
- For SIFBs: you need to regenerate the interface handling code and adjust the method signature of the executeEvent method

Given the gains that you will get from this rework, we believe that this is a small price to pay. 
If you have any questions regarding this change, do not hesitate to contact us!
