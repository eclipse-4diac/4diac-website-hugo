In particular, special thanks go to [KT Elektronik](https://www.kt-elektronik.de/), as they enabled Dirk O Kaar's work on this contribution as part of his employment.
This propelled our integration with Zephyr forward.

This exciting development opens up new possibilities for industrial control systems and automation professionals, 
fostering increased efficiency and flexibility in their projects. 
This integration enables industrial automation developers to leverage the power of Zephyr in their projects within the Eclipse 4diac ecosystem. 

With the addition of Zephyr support, Eclipse 4diac users gain access to a robust and scalable real-time operating system that is perfectly suited for applications in the industrial automation domain. 
Zephyr's lightweight and efficient architecture allows it to run on a wide range of microcontrollers and small footprint devices, making it an ideal choice for resource-constrained environments.


To get started with Eclipse 4diac's Zephyr support, get the latest 4diac FORTE development branch from 
[4diac FORTE's Github repository](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-forte/tree/develop) and the documentation provided in 
the [Readme.MD](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-forte/blob/develop/src/arch/zephyr/README.md) for 4diac FORTEâ€™s Zephyr directory.

For using the latest 4diac FORTE develop version you also need a newer 4diac IDE. 
We recommend using our [pre-built milestone version](https://download.eclipse.org/4diac/updates/milestone/), which gives you a sneak preview of the amazing upcoming 4diac IDE features.
