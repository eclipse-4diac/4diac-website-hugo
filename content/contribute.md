    Sometimes there is not enough info attached to a bug report or it is hard to reproduce. Trying to reproduce a bug and extending the description is of great value.
- Rate Bugs, feature requests, and ideas. This helps that we can focus our limited resources on the most important elements first.

## Development 
- If you are a developer feel free to grab the code and start hacking. You can submit your patch any time when you are ready.
- Extend and improve our FB library: {{< br>}}
  Having a large set of FBs increases the usability of 4diac for developing control solutions.
