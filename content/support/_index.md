## Where should I ask my question?

A simple rule of thumb:

- **Is it a question or discussion others might benefit from later?**  
→ Use [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac).
- **Is it a bug or concrete problem that needs tracking?**  
  → Use [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/eclipse-4diac).
- **You want to discuss an idea or design across components?**  
  → Use the [**mailing list**]( https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/4diac-dev).
- **You just need quick feedback or clarification?**  
  → Try the [**chat**](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-4diac:matrix.eclipse.org).

If in doubt, GitHub is usually the safest choice.

## Before you ask { #before-you-ask }

A few small steps help others help you more effectively:

- Search existing issues and discussions first
- Mention the Eclipse 4diac version you are using
- Include relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages
- If possible, provide a minimal example to reproduce the problem
- Clearly state what you expected to happen and what happened instead

Well-prepared questions tend to receive faster and more precise answers.
